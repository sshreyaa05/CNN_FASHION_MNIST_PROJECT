## Fashion Item Classification Using CNN on the Fashion MNIST Dataset
### Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal was to predict different categories of clothing items using a CNN trained on image features. Preprocessing steps such as normalization, reshaping, and one-hot encoding were applied to ensure proper data formatting and to prepare the model for efficient training. The final CNN model achieved a test accuracy of 90%.
### Objectives
1. Preprocessing and preparing the Fashion MNIST dataset for optimal CNN training.
2. Normalizing image pixel values and reshaping input data for compatibility with the CNN.
3. Performing one-hot encoding on target classes for multi-class classification.
4. Building and training a CNN model to classify clothing items effectively.
### Data Preprocessing
1. Normalization:
Pixel values of the images were scaled to a range between 0 and 1. This step ensured that the CNN model could train efficiently without being affected by variations in raw pixel values.
2. Reshaping:
The image data was reshaped to fit the expected input dimensions of the CNN model. This step ensures compatibility with the convolutional layers.
3. One-Hot Encoding:
Target class labels were one-hot encoded to convert categorical data into a numerical format suitable for multi-class classification with softmax activation in the final layer.
These preprocessing steps improved data quality and allowed the CNN to learn meaningful features during training.
### Model Architecture
After preprocessing, the CNN model was built and trained using multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The model leveraged activation functions like ReLU for feature extraction and softmax in the final layer for classification across the multi-class fashion categories.
### Results
After training the CNN model on the preprocessed Fashion MNIST dataset, the final model achieved a test accuracy of 90%. This demonstrates that the CNN effectively learned patterns from the data to classify different clothing categories with high accuracy.
### Conclusion
The project successfully implemented a CNN pipeline on the Fashion MNIST dataset with preprocessing steps such as normalization, reshaping, and one-hot encoding. The final model achieved a 90% test accuracy, highlighting the power of CNNs in learning and classifying image data.
